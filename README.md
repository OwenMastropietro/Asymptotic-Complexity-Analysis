## Project Description
For this project, we were tasked with exploring the upper bounds of Euclid's Algorithm for computing the Greatest Common Divisor, GCD, exploring three different techniques for computing a<sup>2</sup>, and exploring two common sorting algorithms, insertion sort and selection sort.

**Task 1: FIB & GCD**
- a) Implement an algorithm for computing the gcd of two integers
    - Add Code
- b) Implement an algorithm, that returns the n'th number in the fibonacci sequence.
    - Add Code
- c) Explore GCD(fib(k+1), fib(k))
    - Add Description / What did I find?

**Task 2: Exponentiation**
- a) Decrease by One
- b) Decrease by Constant Factor
- c) Divide and Conquer

**Task 3: Sorting**
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
